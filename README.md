# Lucid (Early Development)

Lucid aims to be a powerful open-source OKR (Objectives and Key Results) tracking tool, designed to align OKRs with your overall company vision and mission.

## Vision

* Establish a clear hierarchy of OKRs connecting individual tasks to your company's vision and mission.
* Track progress with measurable key results.
* Seamlessly integrate with GitHub Issues, Notion, Jira, and other work tools.
* Minimal and intuitive UI for a focused goal-setting experience.
* Guide and give feedback on the things you put in, sort of like an OKR expert. 

## Current Status

This project is in its early stages. The core OKR functionality and foundation for GitHub integration are under development.

## Roadmap (Tentative)

* Establish basic OKR creation and tracking 
* Implement the GitHub Issues integration 
* Design the minimal and intuitive UI
* Explore additional integrations (Notion, Jira, etc.)
* AI that gives feedback on Objectives, Key results, etc
